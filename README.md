## Hello!

My name is Hiram Despain! 
I am a Computer Science Major at Colorado School of Mines. After which, I will get a master's degree in Quantum Engineering. 
I am currently learning Java and improving my abilities with C++. 
I'm working on recoding some earlier C++ projects in Java.
Next semester (Spring 26), among other classes, I will be taking a Quantum Programming class and a Compiler design course. Very excited for both!

Now, setting aside programming related things, I enjoying reading, learning (about almost anything), mathematics, theatre, and rock climbing, among many other things.
