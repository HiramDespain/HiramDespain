## Hello!

My name is Hiram Despain! 
I am a Computer Science Major at Colorado School of Mines. After which, I will get a master's degree in Quantum Engineering. 
I am currently learning Java and improving my abilities with C++. 
In the next couple of months, I plan to explore containerization through Docker and Kubernetes.
I'm working on recoding some earlier c++ projects in Java. I'm also working on a degree/study path planner to help me plan my next couple of years of courses. 

Now, setting aside programming related things, I enjoying reading, learning (about almost anything), mathematics, theatre, and rock climbing, among many other things. 

I'm a bit new to github, so please do give feedback s to how to improve my profile, etc. 
Thank you!
